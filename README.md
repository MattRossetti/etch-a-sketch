## Project Overview
This project creates a fun art tool, an 'Etch-A-Sketch' to be used in your browser. This project was part of the Odin Project's Javascript Fundamentals course.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Lessons Learned
For this project I learned about CSS grid, the draw area is a dynamically created CSS grid, created by Javascript. A big learning for this project was storing states in variables to be used on the webpage, like the brush type, and color selected.

### Future Improvements
Unforuntately When using Chrome the color Picker Loads in the upper left corner of the screen. This can be fixed in the future by using a custom created color picker or by adding a specific color picker html object somewhere on my page. Firefox was used during the development of the webpage which loads the color picker in the center of the screen. This was a good reminder that multiple browsers should be used when testing my webpages!
